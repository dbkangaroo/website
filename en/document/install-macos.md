# Install on MacOS
::: danger Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer(unsigned)
To override your security settings and open the app anyway follow these steps:

1. In the Finder  on your Mac, locate the app you want to open.<br/>
   Don’t use Launchpad to do this. Launchpad doesn’t allow you to access the shortcut menu.
2. Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.
3. Click Open.<br/>
   The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.
